              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.

              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# Marvin 🤖🏖️

![](docs/img/heroes/ai_fn_fruits_hero.png)


Meet Marvin: a batteries-included library for building AI-powered software. Marvin's job is to integrate AI directly into your codebase by making it look and feel like any other function. 

Marvin introduces a new concept called [**AI Functions**](https://askmarvin.ai/guide/concepts/ai_functions). These functions differ from conventional ones in that they don’t rely on source code, but instead generate their outputs on-demand with AI by using an LLM as a runtime. With AI functions, you don't have to write complex code for tasks like extracting entities from web pages, scoring sentiment, or categorizing items in your database. Just describe your needs, call the function, and you're done!

AI functions work with native data types, so you can seamlessly integrate them into any codebase and chain them into sophisticated pipelines. Technically speaking, Marvin transforms the signature of using AI from `(str) -> str` to `(**kwargs) -> Any`. We call this **"functional prompt engineering."**

In addition to AI functions, Marvin also introduces more flexible bots. [**Bots**](https://www.askmarvin.ai/guide/concepts/bots) are highly capable AI assistants that can be given specific instructions and personalities or roles. They can use custom plugins and leverage external knowledge, and automatically create a history of every thread. Under the hood, AI functions are actually a type of bot. 

To make it easy to work with bots, Marvin includes a fully-functional [**TUI**](https://www.askmarvin.ai/guide/concepts/tui). The TUI tracks threads across multiple bots and even lets you manage your bots through a conversational interface.

Developers can use Marvin to add AI capabilities wherever they will be most impactful, without needing to start from scratch. Marvin's documentation is available at [askmarvin.ai](https://www.askmarvin.ai), and say hello on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Kgw4HpcuYG)!

## When should you use Marvin?

Marvin is an opinionated, high-level library with the goal of integrating AI tools into software development. There are a few major reasons to use Marvin:

1. **You want an [AI function](https://askmarvin.ai/guide/concepts/ai_functions) that can process structured data.** Marvin brings the power of AI to native data structures, letting you build functions that would otherwise be difficult or even impossible to write. For example, you can use AI functions to make a list of all the animals in a paragraph, generate JSON documents from HTML content, extract keywords that match some criteria, or categorize sentiment -- without any traditional source code.

2. **You want an [AI assistant](https://askmarvin.ai/guide/concepts/bots) in your code.** Marvin's bots can follow instructions and hold conversations to solve complex problems. They can use custom plugins and take advantage of external knowledge. They are designed to be integrated into your codebase, but of course you can expose them directly to your users as well!

3. **You want to deploy cutting-edge AI technology with confidence, but without having to make too many decisions.** Using LLMs successfully requires very careful consideration of prompts, data preprocessing, and infrastructure. Our target user is more interested in *using* AI systems than *building* AI systems. Therefore, Marvin is designed to make adopting this technology as straightforward as possible by optimizing for useful outcomes. Marvin's prompts have been hardened by months of real-world use and will continue to improve over time.
## When should you NOT use Marvin?
There are a few reasons NOT to use Marvin:

1. **You want full control of the AI.** Marvin is a high-level library and (with few exceptions) does not generally expose LLM configuration to users. We have chosen settings that give the best results under most circumstances, taking Marvin's built-in prompts into consideration.

2. **You want an AI copilot for writing code.** Marvin's job isn't to help you write source code; it's to help you do things that are difficult or impossible to express in source code. That could range from mundane activities to writing a function that can extract the names of animals commonly found in North America from an email (yes, it's a ridiculous example - but it's possible). Modern LLMs excel at complex reasoning, and Marvin lets you bring that into your code in a way that feels native and natural.
   
3. **You want to use other LLM models.** Marvin is designed to run against OpenAI's GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 models. While we may expand those models in the future, we've discovered that prompts designed for one model rarely translate well to others without modification. In order to maximize the usefulness of the library, we've decided to focus on just these popular models for now.

4. **You want full control of your prompts.** As a "functional prompt engineering" platform, Marvin takes user inputs and generates prompts that are likely to deliver the outcome the user wants, even if they are not verbatim what the user said. Marvin does not expect users to send completely raw prompts to the LLM. 
 
5. **You're searching for the Ultimate Question.** While Marvin is highly intelligent, even he couldn't come up with the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. If you're seeking existential enlightenment, you might need to look beyond our beloved paranoid android.
